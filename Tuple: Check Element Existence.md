# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 4, 8, 10)
check_n = 'n' in x
check_8 = 8 in x
print("'n' in tuple:", check_n)
print("8 in tuple:", check_8)
```
## Output
```
'n' in tuple: True
8 in tuple: True
```
## Result
Thus the given program is verified and executed sucessfully
